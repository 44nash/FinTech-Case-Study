  - I dont have much to add because there doing a great job and solving one problem at a time. I might ask for development tool box to make applictions and website with the xrp token like Solidity is for Eth.

- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  - Might help with payments and add a extra sorcue of income if the can somehow monitize the amount going through certain apps if it is built with this dev tool

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  - I guessing something like basic dev tools like html and js while using the token of course. Maybe so type of routing system aswell.

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - basic frame work for building and connection any website to create the internet of thing and as well having the ability to certifie website on the ledger so they to can just be replicated.
